This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming: an infinite loop caused by an improperly constructed `while` loop condition when dealing with arrays containing falsey values or empty arrays. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from the loop not handling the scenario where the array is empty or contains only falsey values, causing the loop counter to never increment and the loop to run indefinitely. The solution introduces checks for empty arrays and appropriate handling to prevent the infinite loop.
